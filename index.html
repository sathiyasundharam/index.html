<p>The design process for a <sup>involves many revisions</sup> to find <cite>the right fit</cite> that meets the needs and desires of the public.<br>Furthermore, interiors and exteriors must be attractive and functional for potential buyers and incorporate innovative features that make the car competitive and newsworthy.<br>
    Engineers make <u>small-scale models</u> in <strong>2D and 3D to test</strong> car designs.<br>These include aerodynamics, safety, temperature, fuel economy, electrical functions, and cost analysis. <br>
    Car <sub> begins only</sub> after design and <mark>engineering specifications</mark> are verified, tested, and approved. <br>The process of car <i>manufacturing is unique</i> to each manufacturer, but there are some standards everyone must follow.</p>
